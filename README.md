# CSharp Learning Projects

Welcome to my C# learning repository! 👨‍💻

## 📁 Folder Structure:

### 📂 `cod/`
Contains **100+ simple C# console applications** created throughout my learning journey.  
These programs cover basic syntax, logic, control structures, and fundamental features of the C# language.  
This folder reflects my daily practice and consistent growth as a developer.

---

### 📂 `LearningProjects/`
This folder contains more **complete, structured mini-projects** that go beyond basic tasks.  
Each project here is focused on simulating real-world functionality using OOP, collections, and good code structure.

#### ✅ Current projects:
- `ToDoList` — A simple console-based task manager that allows you to:
  - Add tasks
  - View all tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Delete tasks
  - Filter completed tasks (with LINQ)
